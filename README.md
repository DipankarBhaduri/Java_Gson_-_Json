## Introduction to Gson

Gson is a powerful Java library developed by Google for JSON processing. It provides a simple and flexible API to serialize Java objects to JSON and deserialize JSON back to Java objects. This tutorial will cover the basics of Gson, from installation to advanced usage.

## Getting Started

Follow the step-by-step guide in the [Getting Started](getting_started.md) section to set up Gson in your Java project. This section covers project setup, library installation, and a simple example to ensure everything is working.

## Serialization

Learn the ins and outs of Java-JSON Serialization with Gson. The [Serialization](serialization.md) section dives deep into converting Java objects to JSON representation, exploring various Gson annotations and customization options.

## Deserialization

In the [Deserialization](deserialization.md) section, discover how to transform JSON data back into Java objects. Explore Gson's features for handling nested objects, polymorphism, and more.

## Advanced Topics

The [Advanced Topics](advanced_topics.md) section delves into advanced Gson features, such as custom serializers/deserializers, handling different data types, and best practices for optimal performance.
